<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Xen Cloud Platform and Citrix Xenserver include XE, a very powerful command for doing low-level administration of xapi clouds. Most of the xe help output is auto-generated within the xe source and there no manual pages at all currently. </p>

<p>This project's purpose is to create manpages for all 418 xe subcommands as well as engineer a more manageable solution to maintaining both xe help and xe manpages in the future.</p>

<h2>Who are the Xenapi Admin Project team members?</h2>

<p>The Xenapi Admin Project is made mostly of degreed technical professionals in the Seattle Washington area (and one Computer Science professor). The team meets in person for documentation peer review every other week. They also participate in monthly Xen Document Days and on the Xen mailing lists. You can learn more about the project and follow status reports at <a href="http://xenapiadmin.com">http://xenapiadmin.com</a>.</p>
