{"name":"Xe-manpages","tagline":"","body":"xe-manpages\r\n===========\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n------------\r\n\r\nXen Cloud Platform and Citrix Xenserver include XE, a very powerful command for doing low-level administration of xapi clouds. Most of the xe help output is auto-generated within the xe source and there no manual pages at all currently. \r\n\r\nThis project's purpose is to create manpages for all 418 xe subcommands as well as engineer a more manageable solution to maintaining both xe help and xe manpages in the future.\r\n\r\nWho are the Xenapi Admin Project team members?\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe Xenapi Admin Project is made mostly of degreed technical professionals in the Seattle Washington area (and one Computer Science professor). The team meets in person for documentation peer review every other week. They also participate in monthly Xen Document Days and on the Xen mailing lists. You can learn more about the project and follow status reports at http://xenapiadmin.com.\r\n\r\nWhy Contribute?\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nFor the feeling in the knowledge of a job well done! Actually contributing to the Xenapi Admin Project does several things. \r\n\r\n1. Increase your visibility to perspective employers\r\n2. Give you motivation to learn new skills ie. Cloud Computing/Asciidoc/XSLT \r\n3. Help you to learn technical writing under the tutelage of experienced writers\r\n\r\nHow to Contribute\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n1. Fork the xe-manpages git repository by going to  and clicking *Fork* \r\nhttps://raw.github.com/Xenapi-Admin-Project/xe-manpages/master/media/fork-xe-manpages.png\r\n\r\n2. Claim a command – Locate the xe-subcommands text file (xe-manpages/xe-subcommands.txt) and put your name next to the command you wish to document.\r\n\r\n3. Do a pull request – Click *Pull Request* on the repository page. We will review your request to work on the manpage for the command(s) you've claimed.\r\n\r\n4. Review the Manpage Style Guide – Look over the manpage style guide (/xe-manpages/guides/Manpage_Style_Guide.txt), and pay special attention to the styles and structure presented in the guide. Use the examples at the bottom of the guide to assist you in creating your first page.\r\n\r\n5. Familiarize yourself with asciidoc, the markup language the Xenapi Admin Project uses to write manpages in - http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/chunked/index.html\r\n\r\n6. Use our asciidoc templates (/xe-manpages/docs/source/asciidoc/TEMPLATES) and write the manpage.\r\n\r\n7. Manpage Pull request – When you are happy with the state of your manpage, then do another pull request and the team will be notified.\r\n\r\n8. Review - Our team of technical writers will review your manpage and offer our input. When it's done we'll push it into RELEASE and push it up to xen-org.\r\n\r\nBecome Famous\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nWell, maybe not famous but you can add your contribution to your resume and LinkedIn account to show future employers that you've contributed to an open source project.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
