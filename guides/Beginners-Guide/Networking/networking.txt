XCP Networking

Networks 

What is a network?

A network is a virtual ethernet switch on a XCP host.

Types of networks

	* single-server private networks - is an internal network with no connection to the outside world that allows virtual machines to communicate on a XCP host.										
	* cross-server private networks - functions much like a single-server private network, but allows VMs on different hosts to commuciate.
	* external networks - are networks that provide a connection to the outside world through a PIF.
	* vlans - are networks that are connected to a physical VLAN.
	* bonded networks - are networks that provide a redudant connection to the outside world through a bond.

How to create a network?

	* xe network-create creates an internal network with no connection to the outside world.
	
How to remove a network?

	* xe network-destroy will destroy a network. xe network-destroy requires that the network has no active PIF connections.
	
	
PIFs

What is a PIF?

	* A physical interface (PIF) represents a physical NIC on a XCP host. The PIF has a name, a description, a unique UUID, and other parameters that contain information about its network and host.

Types of PIFs

We classify PIFs based on their configuration.

	*	Primary management interface (PIF) - This PIF is designated when you first install XCP. It allows your XCP host to connect to your network and carries management traffic for communicating to 		other hosts in your pool.
	
	*	Management - A management PIF is a PIF with IP addressing configured.
	
How to create a PIF?
	
	* PIFs are assosiated with physical NICs, so when you first install XCP, for every physical NIC found on the XCP host a PIF with a network is created. 
	
	* To add a new PIF: Install the physical NIC, restart the server, run the xe pif-scan command, and a new PIF and network will be created.


VIFS

What is a VIF?
	
	A virtual interface (VIF) is assoisated with a VM and a network, which allows a VM to commuciate with other hosts.
	
How to create a VIF?

	xe vif-create will create a new VIF and connect it to a VM and a network. If the VM is running, you need to attach it to the VM using xe vif-plug. VIFs created to a halted VM will be started on boot. You can also use xe vif-unplug to detach a VIF from a VM.
