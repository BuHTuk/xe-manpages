There are options available to managing virtual machines including starting, pausing, recovering, and deleting them. 


*Address the universal –force and –multiple options


Option
	Description
	--force 
	forces the operation to be performed on the VM and bypasses system warnings
	--multiple 
	perform the operation on multiple VMs
	

(do you need uuids for multiple virtual machines? test to see if the multiple option applies to ALL virtual machines or certain ones)


To see a list of virtual machines, use the xe vm-list command. The list can be filtered based on parameter values. 


For example, xe vm-list power-state=halted will only display a list of virtual machines that are halted. Another example would be xe vm-list params=name-label, power-state to get the name and its power state of each virtual machine.


Starting VMs
To start a virtual machine, use the vm-start command.
Options:
on=
paused=
vm=<VM UUID or VM name>


Pausing VMs
*check into vm-pause
*difference between pausing and suspending; something having to do with “releasing” memory
*what happens if you don't provide a UUID (xe help says no UUID is required)


Rebooting VMs
*check into vm-reboot


Recovering VMs
*check into xe vm-recover
*when would you want to recover a virtual machine


Consoling into VMs
*use xe console on the command line
xe console vm=<name or UUID>
*list GUIs ?


Deleting VMs
*use vm-destroy
*explain what happens when the virtual machine gets destroyed; can no longer be recovered. What happens to its virtual disks?
*difference between vm-uninstall and vm-destroy
xe vm-uninstall will delete the VDIs attached to the virtual machine.
xe vm-destroy deletes the VM but its VDI will be stored in its storage repository.


Importing/Exporting VMs
*use vm-import or vm-export
*consider server type? (xe help mentioned server type)


Shutting down VMs
*use xe vm-shutdown


Troubleshooting VMs
*what if the vm is “stuck”


Snapshotting VMs
*check in xe vm-snapshot


Configuring VMs
*how to change parameters using the parameter commands


*difference between checkpoint and snapshot?
