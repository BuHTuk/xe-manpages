There are options available to managing virtual machines including starting, pausing, recovering, and deleting them. 

*Address the universal –force and –multiple options; move this down towards the bottom

Option	         Description
--force          Forces the operation to be performed on the VM and bypasses system warnings
--multiple       Perform the operation on multiple VMs
	
(Test to see if the multiple option applies to ALL virtual machines or certain ones)

To see a list of virtual machines, use the xe vm-list command. The list can be filtered based on parameter values. For example, xe vm-list power-state=halted will only display a list of virtual machines that are halted. Another example would be xe vm-list params=name-label, power-state to get the name and its power state of each virtual machine.

Starting VMs
To start a virtual machine, use the vm-start command.
*Example of how to start a vm with a uuid
*Example of how to start a vm with a parameter condition e.g. power-state=halted
Options:
on=
paused=
vm=<VM UUID or VM name>

Pausing VMs
*use vm-pause
*difference between pausing and suspending; something having to do with “releasing” memory
*what happens if you don't provide a UUID (xe help says no UUID is required)

Rebooting VMs
*use vm-reboot

Recovering VMs
*use xe vm-recover

Consoling into VMs
*use xe console on the command line
xe console vm=<name or UUID>
*How to for versions 1.0/1.1 and 1.5/1.6; look at tutorials
*list other methods

Deleting VMs
*use vm-destroy
*explain what happens when the virtual machine gets destroyed; can no longer be recovered. What happens to its virtual disks?
*difference between vm-uninstall and vm-destroy; focus on uninstall for now
xe vm-uninstall will delete the VDIs attached to the virtual machine.
xe vm-destroy deletes the VM but its VDIs will be stored in the storage repository.

Importing/Exporting VMs
*use vm-import or vm-export
*consider server type? (xe help mentioned server type)

Shutting down VMs
*use xe vm-shutdown

Troubleshooting VMs
*what if the vm is “stuck”

Snapshotting VMs
*check in xe vm-snapshot
*difference between checkpoint and snapshot

Configuring VMs
*how to change parameters using the parameter commands
