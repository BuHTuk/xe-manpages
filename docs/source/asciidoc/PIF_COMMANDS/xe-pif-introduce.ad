NAME
-----
xe-pif-introduce - Creates a new PIF interface

SYNOPSIS
--------
*xe pif-introduce* host-uuid=<Host UUID> device=<Network Device> [ mac=<Mac Address> ] 


DESCRIPTION
-----------
// Do you mean... *xe pif-introduce* creates a new PIF interface associated with a network device (e.g. eth0) found on a specific host.
// The PIF interface inherits the MAC address of the physical device (e.g. ?) unless it is manually configured(?).
// *xe pif-introduce* generates a PIF UUID for the new PIF interface.
//
// I kept your original description in case I misunderstood you. 
// I have a hard time picturing things in my head and examples would help to see things clearer -lisa

*xe pif-introduce* creates a new PIF interface associated with an unassigned network device (e.g. eth0) found on the specified host. The PIF interface will inherit the 
MAC address of the physical network device (e.g. eth0) unless specified. The resulting PIF UUID is returned. 

*xe pif-introduce* will create a new PIF interface by
