NAME
-----
foo - frobnicate the bar library

SYNOPSIS
--------
*foo* [*-bar*] [*-b* | *--busy*] [*-c* 'config-file' | *--config=*'config-file'] [{*-e* | *--example*} 'this'] [{*-e* | *--example*} {'this' | 'that'}] 'file(s)'...

*foo* [{*-h* | *--help*} | {*-v* | *--version*}]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*foo* frobnicates the bar library by tweaking internal symbol tables. By default it parses all baz segments and rearranges them in reverse
order by time for the *xyzzy*(1) linker to find them. The symdef entry is then compressed using the WBG (Whiz-Bang-Gizmo) algorithm. All
files are processed in the order specified.

OPTIONS
-------
*-b, --busy*::
	Do not write “busy” to stdout while processing.

*-c* 'config-file', *--config=*'config-file'::
	Use the alternate system wide 'config-file' instead of the /etc/foo.conf. This overrides any *FOOCONF* environment variable.

*-a*::
	In addition to the baz segments, also parse the *blurfl*(3) headers.

*-r*::
	Recursive mode. Operates as fast as lightning at the expense of a megabyte of virtual memory.

	
FILES
------
/etc/foo.conf::
	The system-wide configuration file. See *foo.conf*(5) for further details.

$\{HOME\}/.foo.conf::
	The per-user configuration file. See *foo.conf*(5) for further details.
	
	
ENVIRONMENT
----------     
*FOOCONF*::
	The full pathname for an alternate system wide configuration file *foo.conf*(5) (see also the section called “FILES”). Overridden by the
	*-c* option.


DIAGNOSTICS
-----------
The following diagnostics may be issued on stderr:
Item one
“Bad magic number.”::
	The input file does not look like an archive file.

“Old style baz segments.”::
	foo can only handle new style baz segments.  COBOL object libraries are not supported in this version.

The following return codes can be used in scripts:

[frame="none",valign="top",pageunits="pt",pagewidth="10000"]
|=======
|'Errorcode'|'Errortext'|'Diagnostic'
|0 |Program exited normally.|No error. Program ran successfully.
|1 |Bad magic number.|The input file does not look like an archive file.
|2 |Old style baz segments.|foo can only handle new style baz segments. COBOL object libraries are not supported in this version.
|=======
                               

                                       
BUGS
-----
The command name should have been chosen more carefully to reflect its purpose.

The upstreams BTS can be found at http://bugzilla.foo.tld.
